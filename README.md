# web_scraping
For a data project, we gotta extract data from a beauty page ,so we did it!

In this project I used playwright, pandas libraries to handle this extracting.
at the beginning, I tried to scrape the pages via selenium and bs4 but It didn't work as result I worked with playwright (https://github.com/oxylabs/playwright-web-scraping)
after that, I saved the whole products which were extracted by that packages into .csv to archive the data.
